# CS1

This is a repository containing the projects that I have completed in CS 1. The course description is as follows:

"A course on computer programming emphasizing the program design process and pragmatic programming skills. It will use the
Python programming language and will not assume previous programming experience. Material covered will include data types, 
variables, assignment, control structures, functions, scoping, compound data, string processing, modules, basic input/output
(terminal and file), as well as more advanced topics such as recursion, exception handling and object-oriented programming.
Program development and maintenance skills including debugging, testing, and documentation will also be taught. Assignments
will include problems drawn from fields such as graphics, numerics, networking, and games."
